# Thinktecture Boardist

Thinktecture Boardist is a sample application for a simple offline synchronization utilizing ServiceWorker.

The demo application is meant for workshops and talks about offline sync starting from a _brownfield project_. That's why the repo is split into two branches:

* [develop](https://github.com/thinktecture/thinktecture-boardist/tree/develop): pure online application, no offline sync
* [offline](https://github.com/thinktecture/thinktecture-boardist/tree/offline): changes needed for a brownfield application to support a simple offline synchronization.
